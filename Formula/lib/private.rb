# GitHubPrivateRepositoryDownloadStrategy downloads contents from GitHub
# Private Repository. To use it, add
# `:using => GitHubPrivateRepositoryDownloadStrategy` to the URL section of
# your formula. This download strategy uses GitHub access tokens (in the
# environment variables `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`) to sign the request.  This
# strategy is suitable for corporate use just like S3DownloadStrategy, because
# it lets you use a private GitHub repository for internal distribution.  It
# works with public one, but in that case simply use CurlDownloadStrategy.
